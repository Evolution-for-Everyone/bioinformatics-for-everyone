## üçÑ¬†Notes

- **Letty provided a summary of Evolution for Everyone**
    - Started as an independent, volunteer project in 2023 with the first workshop in Brazil at the Federal University of Sao Paulo
    - Applied for funding and received the DRI-EDIA Champions grant from the Digital Research Alliance of Canada
    - Officially launched E4E as an outreach project to promote equitable access to knowledge, resources and opportunities in evolutionary biology, empowering equity-deserving students to become scientists
    - Developed a [GitHub organization page](https://github.com/Evolution-for-Everyone) with [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Evolution-for-Everyone/repositories) for Evolution for Everyone
    - Developed a collaborative repository [Bioinformatics for Everyone](https://github.com/Evolution-for-Everyone/bioinformatics-for-everyone) to store bioinformatics tutorials and workshops
        - Developed a wiki page populated with 5 bioinformatics tutorials (and counting): [https://github.com/Evolution-for-Everyone/bioinformatics-for-everyone/wiki](https://github.com/Evolution-for-Everyone/bioinformatics-for-everyone/wiki)
        - tutorials were tested by 5 undergraduate students co-mentored by Letty and Joe with overall positive feedback
    - Current work:
        - Writing new tutorials (codeml tutorial #2, Digital Research Alliance tutorial)
        - Turning tutorials into YouTube videos
    - Upcoming event: The molecular evolution starter pack **workshop at UBC Vancouver
        - May 25 & 27 (9 am - 4 pm)
        - collaborative work with DRI-EDIA grant holder Amy Kim
        - include pre and post skill assessment questionnaire - if possible
            - Ben mentioned that demographic information would be interesting ‚Üí if we intend to collect that for publication, ethics permission is required

        Ideas for future workshops:
        
        - good housekeeping in bioinformatics
        - Developing your own pipeline
        - Working on high performance computer clusters
        - GitHub and managing data with version control
        </aside>
        
- **Ben shared about CBH's work, goals, content/resources and partnerships**
    - Intended audience CBH: graduate students
    - Joe's suggestion: making students aware that these are transferable skills and making that clear throughout planning and development
        - Highlight transferable skills that can be used outside of academia
    - Ben  will send us a list of transferable skills for a career in bioinformatics ‚Üí currently published somewhere in the website of the International Society for Computational Biology
        - list of 14 items including knowledge and skills for bioinformaticians ‚Üí in the future, individuals will be able to log in on the website and see their progress in this ‚Äúpath"
    - CBH‚Äôs survey results
        - deficits related to fundamental skills on data science
        - how to manage data with version control
        - using resources like high performance computer clusters
        - basic statistics
        - practical skills
        - Did people ask about specific tools? (Letty will email Ben to follow up)
    - CBH's interests and future goals
        - having more introductory content - their largest gap according to survey
        - Rob wants to start partnerships with people that are teaching a bioinformatics course for undergraduates in our university
        - Short workshops during conferences ‚Üí Evolution? (Letty will follow up on this)
        - Bioinformatics 101 - intro to bioinformatics and data science at beginning of academic year
    - Benefits of a partnership with CBH
        - Advertise resources on Canada Bioinformatics Hub website
        - Unlimited access to Ben (regional coordinator)
        - Possibility to re-use information available on their platforms with Creative Commons license
        
- **We discussed a partnership between E4E and CBH**
    - Joe mentioned our overall idea of promoting exchange between East and West Canada, since we have a partnership with UBC now
        - Ben will send me details of the BC coordinator
    - Organizing a workshop **E4E + CBH**
        - will probably happen over the summer
        - CBHch prefers a shorter format ‚Üí 2 days
    - Next steps for Letty:
        - looking at the proposing a workshop form
        - submit a 2-day proposal workshop for the CBH with my greatest hits
        - I would get a contract for developing the material and delivering it
        - Ask if Yuri can participate
