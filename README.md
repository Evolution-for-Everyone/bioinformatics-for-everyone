# Bioinformatics for everyone

Welcome to Bioinformatics for Everyone, an outreach project to make bioinformatics more accessible to students and scientists across the world! <br>
Our **mission** is to promote equitable access to knowledge, resources and opportunities in evolutionary biology, empowering equity-deserving to become scientists.

ü¶ã We offer free workshops in universities! <br>
_if you are interested in having a workshop at your university, please reach out at leticiamagpali@dal.ca <br>_

ü¶ã You can also learn by yourself right here! <br>
To acess all our workshops tutorials, data and materials, as well as outside resources, check our [wiki page](https://github.com/leticiamagpali/bioinformatics-for-everyone/wiki).

ü¶ã If you are a collaborator, find our project roadmap [here](https://github.com/Evolution-for-Everyone/bioinformatics-for-everyone/issues/1).

ü¶ã Bioinformatics for Everyone has received funding and support from the following organizations:

* Digital Alliance of Canada's EDIA Champions Program
* OLS Open Seeds Mentoring and Training Program

## üçÑ What is Bioinformatics? ##
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In simple terms, **Bioinformatics is using computers and programing languages to analyse biological data** <br>
> You can analyse a lot of different data using bioinformatics, such as genetic sequences, measurements taken in the field, or the results of an experiment you did at the lab üß¨

![FUN FACT! (5)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d013a06d-c62d-4fe9-89eb-4ea085aed1e2) <br>
(By the end of our course, you will understand this joke o/)


## üçÑ Why Bioinformatics for everyone? ##
Bioinformatics is becoming increasignly important in every field of biology, from genomics and biochemestry to behavioral ecology and conservation. <br>
Bioinformatic tools increase our ability to colect, store and process large amounts of data <br>
At the same time, biologists (you and me!) are not properly trained to use computational tools, and this lack of training has many reasons:
* bioinformatic tools and methods are oftentimes complicated for first time users, and require a lot of training
* a lot of universities still don't offer bioinformatics courses in the biology program
* taking courses on your own can be very expensive and time consuming <br>
  _(PS: you can learn how to program online in various languages - click here for a list of free/afordable courses - but the courses to learn how to run computational analyses are scarse and expensive)_

## üçÑ Who makes Bioinformatics for everyone? ##

## üçÑ Our values ##

ü¶ã Knowledge is plural and that's beautiful! <br>
ü¶ã Knowledge should be open, equitably shared and accessible to everyone (whenever possible) <br>
ü¶ã Science should be inclusive, acessible and collaborative
