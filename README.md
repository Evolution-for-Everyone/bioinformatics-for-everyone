## üçÑ Why Bioinformatics for everyone? ##
Bioinformatics - aka using computers and programing to analyse biological data - is becoming increasignly important in every field of biology.
At the same time, biologists (us!) are not properly trained to use computational tools, and this lack of training has many reasons:
* bioinformatic tools and methods are oftentimes complicated for first time users, and require a lot of training
* a lot of universities still don't offer bioinformatics courses in the biology program
* taking courses on your own can be very expensive and time consuming
    * you can learn how to program online in various languages (for a list of free/afordable courses, see this) - but the courses to learn how to run computational analyses are scarse and expensive
