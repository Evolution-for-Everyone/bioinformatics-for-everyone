# Bioinformatics for everyone

Welcome to Bioinformatics for Everyone, an outreach project to make bioinformatics more accessible to students across the world! <br>

ü¶ã We offer free workshops in universities across the world! <br>
_if you are interested in having a workshop at your university, please reach out at leticiamagpali@dal.ca <br>_

ü¶ã You can also learn by yourself right here! <br>
To acess all our workshops tutorials, data and materials, check our [wiki page](https://github.com/leticiamagpali/bioinformatics-for-everyone/wiki).

## üçÑ What is Bioinformatics? ##
In simple terms, Bioinformatics is **using computers and programing languages to analyse biological data** - such as genetic sequences, measurements taken in the field, or the results of an experiment you did at the lab

## üçÑ Why Bioinformatics for everyone? ##
Bioinformatics is becoming increasignly important in every field of biology, from genomics and biochemestry to behavioral ecology and conservation. <br>
At the same time, biologists (you and me!) are not properly trained to use computational tools, and this lack of training has many reasons:
* bioinformatic tools and methods are oftentimes complicated for first time users, and require a lot of training
* a lot of universities still don't offer bioinformatics courses in the biology program
* taking courses on your own can be very expensive and time consuming <br>
  _(PS: you can learn how to program online in various languages - click here for a list of free/afordable courses - but the courses to learn how to run computational analyses are scarse and expensive)_
